## Working Style

**Team Projects:** I prefer to start with a well-structured plan before taking action. I then collaborate with the team to refine the plan, ensuring everyone understands their role and can contribute based on their expertise.  

**Personal Projects:** I begin by researching and reviewing relevant documentation. After that, I develop a clear project plan, iteratively adjusting as needed. I also maintain snapshots or backups whenever significant changes are made to the original plan.
